I am a  Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Delaware](https://ce.udel.edu/people/faculty-profile/?id=20). I received an MA and PhD degrees in Civil Engineering and Operations Research (Water Resources Engineering) from [Princeton University](https://cee.princeton.edu/), an MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering (Water Resources Engineering) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/civil-environmental-engineering/), and a BS degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the [University of Cincinnati](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/civil-architectural-engineering-construction-management.html). I worked as a civil engineer for [Ashland Oil Company](https://www.ashland.com/), and a water resources engineer for [Meade and Hunt, Inc](https://meadhunt.com/). Following my PhD, I was a post-doctoral research associate and then research assistant professor in environmental engineering at the [University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/envr/environmental-sciences-and-engineering-home/). 

My research focus is the movement of fluids and mass transfer processes in porous media, with a particular emphasis on model development and application. My research has spanned a range of environmental problems including soil and groundwater remediation, design of landfill cover systems to enhance oxidation of fugitive landfill gas, and more recently modification of geomedia (e.g., amendment with biochar) in stormwater treatment systems to enhance pollutant removal.  


For Prospective Students
======
* I am looking for one motivated MS student to start in 2022 Winter (starts in January/February) to work on a project evaluating diurnal variations of methane emissions from landfills. This project is a collaboration with faculty from the University of California-Davis and the University of Southampton (UK) and will involve data analysis and mathematical modeling. If you're interested, please send me an email or apply through the [UD Graduate Applications](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/grad/prospective-students/grad-admissions/) system. Please use "Prospective Grad student [Your name]" as your email subject and attach your CV, a brief research statement (one page or less), and transcripts. Due to the large volume of emails, I apologize for not replying to individual inquiries I have received.

* I am looking for 1-2 PhD students for 2022 Fall (starts in August/September) who are interested in applications of biochar to alter soil hydrology and nutrient fate in urban soils and living shorelines. If you're interested, please send me an email or apply through the [UD Graduate Applications](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/grad/prospective-students/grad-admissions/) system. Please use "Prospective PhD student [Your name]" as your email subject and attach your CV, a brief research statement (one page or less), and transcripts. Due to the large volume of emails, I apologize for not replying to individual inquiries I have received.

Graduate Program to Apply Under:
===
* I have advised graduate students concentrating in environmental engineering or water resources engineering within the [Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the University of Delaware](https://ce.udel.edu/academics/graduate/). I have recently advised graduate students in the [Interdisciplinary Program in Water Science and Policy](https://www.udel.edu/academics/colleges/canr/departments/plant-and-soil-sciences/graduate-programs/water-science-policy/), where I now serve as Assistant Director. Depending on a student's background and interests, you may apply to any of these programs to work under my direction.

Current Research Interests
======
* Modeling the effect of biochar on soil structure and soil hydrology
* Altering urban soils to increase stormwater infiltration and nutrient transformation
* Influence of biochar on plant growth, root structure, and infiltration capacity of soils and engineered geomedia
* Remediation of soils contaminated by spills of fracking fluids
* Greenhouse gas emissions from landfills - measurement, modeling, and control
