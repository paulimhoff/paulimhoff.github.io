I am a  Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Delaware](https://ce.udel.edu/people/faculty-profile/?id=20). I received an MA and PhD degrees in Civil Engineering and Operations Research (Water Resources Engineering) from [Princeton University](https://cee.princeton.edu/), an MS in Civil and Environmental Engineering (Water Resources Engineering) from the [University of Wisconsin-Madison](https://www.engr.wisc.edu/department/civil-environmental-engineering/), and a BS degree in Civil and Environmental Engineering from the [University of Cincinnati](https://ceas.uc.edu/academics/departments/civil-architectural-engineering-construction-management.html). I worked as a civil engineer for [Ashland Oil Company](https://www.ashland.com/), and a water resources engineer for [Meade and Hunt, Inc.](https://meadhunt.com/). Following my PhD, I was a post-doctoral researh associate and then research assistant professor in environmental engineering at the [University of North Carolina-Chapel Hill](https://sph.unc.edu/envr/environmental-sciences-and-engineering-home/). 

My current research centers 



For Prospective Students/Postdocs
======
* I am looking for one motivated Postdoc Associate to start in 2022 Winter in (1) spatiotemporal modeling and (2) reinforcement learning for transit operation. Please send me an email (subject: "Prospective Postdoc Associate [Your name]") with your CV, a brief research statement (one page or less) and transcripts.
* I am looking for 1-2 PhD students for 2022 Winter/Fall (starts in January/September) who are excited about machine learning for smart transportation. If you're interested, please send me an email or apply through the [McGill uApply](https://www.mcgill.ca/uapply) system. Please use "Prospective PhD student [Your name]" as your email subject. Due to the large volume of emails, I apologize for not replying to individual inquries I have received. 
* See [more info about Civil Engineering @ McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/grad).
<!-- Ben Barres' advice on [How to Pick a Graduate Advisor](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2013.10.005).*/ -->
* If you have a good record in mathematics/machine learning, you are encouraged to apply for the [IVADO graduate student scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/excellence-scholarships/).
* Postdocs or final year PhD students with strong mathematics/machine learning background (and also application in smart transportation, e.g., spatiotemporal prediction, generative model for urban activity) are __strongly encouraged__ to apply for the [IVADO postdoc scholarship](https://ivado.ca/en/ivado-scholarships/postdoctoral-scholarships/). Very competitive package!
