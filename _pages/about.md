I am a  Professor in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering at the [University of Delaware](https://ce.udel.edu/people/faculty-profile/?id=20). I received my PhD degree in Civil Engineering (Transportation) from [National University of Singapore](http://www.eng.nus.edu.sg/cee/), and earned a Bachelor degree in Civil Engineering from [Tsinghua University](http://www.civil.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/). During my PhD, I worked at Mobility and Transport Planning module at the [Future Cities Laboratory](http://www.fcl.ethz.ch/), Singapore-ETH center. Prior to joining McGill, I was a Postdoctoral Associate at [MIT Media Lab](https://www.media.mit.edu/). 

My current research centers on the area of smart transportation and urban computing, developing innovative methodologies and applications to address efficiency, resilience, and sustainability issues in urban transportation systems. I am particularly interested in integrating advances in machine learning into human mobility modeling, agent-based simulation, and intelligent transportation systems. My previous work has been featured in some popular media outlets, including Wired, Citylab, Scientific American, and MIT Technology Review.



For Prospective Students/Postdocs
======
* I am looking for one motivated Postdoc Associate to start in 2022 Winter in (1) spatiotemporal modeling and (2) reinforcement learning for transit operation. Please send me an email (subject: "Prospective Postdoc Associate [Your name]") with your CV, a brief research statement (one page or less) and transcripts.
* I am looking for 1-2 PhD students for 2022 Winter/Fall (starts in January/September) who are excited about machine learning for smart transportation. If you're interested, please send me an email or apply through the [McGill uApply](https://www.mcgill.ca/uapply) system. Please use "Prospective PhD student [Your name]" as your email subject. Due to the large volume of emails, I apologize for not replying to individual inquries I have received. 
* See [more info about Civil Engineering @ McGill University](https://www.mcgill.ca/civil/grad).
